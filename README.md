Udemy RGB Game project

This game is ask you to click the random-generated blocks to match the provided RGB(red, green, blue) or the target color, if you got it right, all the blocks and heading background will change to the target color, otherwise, the block will disappear. it has easy mode and hard mode, easy mode has 3 blocks, hard mode has 6 blocks.
I added a maximum pay times, 3; 
I also added an additional reset button and score board to record how many scores you get and how many clicks you have clicked during the 3 times of play.
